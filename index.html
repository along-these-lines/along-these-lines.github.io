    <p>An urbanism professor once told us: “When I was studying architecture back in the 90s, everything  was about context.”  One day, we will say the same thing about <i>community</i>.</p>

    <p>Architects have become marketers. Their obsession with the word community, like the designer’s and the political strategist’s, is praise for an empty vessel. Under its guise, power structures are concealed while endless discussions are held to produce only empty gestures or some new guideline for the color and placement of a park bench.</p>

    <p>Nowhere is this clearer than in our current crisis. As disease sweeps the world, grocery clerks, bus drivers, nurses, and all those at the front lines confront a terrifying world. All while, from behind closed doors, their bosses exclaim: we are all in this together.</p>

    <p>If the promise of community is a disguise for a never ending present, the experts have offered us no real futures, either. They have scrambled to incorporate this latest break into their final, grand, unified theory of capitalism.  Too many academics have offered us only provocations, myopic models, and data. Human life abstracted into symbols and formulas. With no real ground in the present, their futures offer us theoretical spectacles or dreams of 20th century revolutions.</p>

    <p>We have hit a crisis of imagination. The explosion of crisis only highlights the long and slow and constant crisis we have always lived in: <i>Our futures are lost and our present deteriorates endlessly ahead of us.</i></p>

    <p>But we are tired of cynicism and empty models. There have been calls to refuse the return to normalcy and to imagine new futures. But if we are to reject the spectres of false community and dead revolutions, what is there left?</p>

    <p>It is from this possibility that we must begin: we can only grow real futures on shared soil.</p>

    <p>Across the world, there are groups that have nurtured relations and practices that act against the abyss that has opened beneath us. Everywhere, there are bursts of imagination and new ways of life blossoming.</p>

    <p>Along These Lines is a space to document, continue, and begin conversations. As a direct challenge to our inability to claim the future, we look to exploration, nurturing, and imagination. Across scales, mediums, and disciplines, we explore and learn from ways of life already growing and develop the tools and practices to cultivate ones yet to exist.</p>

    <p>We maintain that <i>utopia</i> still has its place in our vocabulary. Fueled by these ideals, we pursue the possibility of new futures found in a sincere commitment to one another and to action. Against empty vessels, abstract impositions, and the ongoing abyss, we look to the joy of walking together and nurturing shared grounds.</p>
